Feel free to use this as a scratch-pad/journal to keep notes on what you accomplished. To avoid merge conflicts you might consider either:
1. put notes on others' contributions at the TOP. Git is pretty good at merging text changes when there aren't overlaps. I think we'll mostly be editing our own notes, and I don't think there's a chance of merge conflict when a text insert happens at the top of a document if only 1 person adds to it at a time (leaving rest of the document for the primary author to edit)
2. Or, open a pull request and assign to the person whose file you edited (that way they are sure to be aware what changes you made and can be sure to pull these changes in before making subsequent edits of their own.)
