    "## Description of Snake Game Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake is a fully-observable, one-player game. The game updates in discrete time steps, the rate of which is controlled either by a framerate parameter, or allowed to update as quickly as the agent provides inputs (for training purposes or to speed up test/evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The player or agent controls a \"snake\" character in a 2-dimensional grid. At each discrete timestep the player or agent may take one of two actions, turn left or turn right, or choose to do nothing (continue straight). Stated alternatively, the agent may choose to \"move left\", \"move right\", \"move up\", or \"move down\" at each timestep. However, it's invalid for a snake to turn 180 degrees; the snake's head would always collide with its body, causing the game to be over. The game engine simply disallows these illegal turns by ignoring inputs that would cause them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Food\" particles are scattered at random locations throughout the game such that no two food particles may occupy the same location. All food particles have the same value, causing the snake to grow by one grid space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics of snake growth are such that, on the time step following the intersection of the snake's head and a piece of food, the snakes head proceeds forward one space while the tip of the snakes tail remains fixed in place (for that time step in which the snake is growing.) On time steps in which the snake does not grow, the snakes head advances in the direction indicated by the agent's inputs and the final/tail segment of the snake's body is removed simultaneously (thus, the snake remains fixed in length, but appears to have moved forward such that the body always follows the same path through the game's grid space as the head).\n",

    "## Theoretical Best Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Snake Length\n",
    "Snake length is maximized when snake occupies the entire play space + 1. By the pigeon-hole principle, the snakes head must either be out of bounds or occupying the same location as another body segment. In other words, the snake must always lose when `|snake| = grid_area + 1; grid_area = W + H` where `|snake|` is length of snake, `W` is how many discrete blocks wide the game is, and `H` is similarly grid height. Thus, best possible score, if score is length of snake, is `grid_area + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time to Snake Length |N|\n",
    "Calculating a theoretical best input is tricky due to\n",
    "1. the random nature of the food spawn\n",
    "2. multiple food spawn\n",
    "3. food may spawn \"under\" snake\n",
    "4. snake must navigate around its own body to get to food, and body is also moving\n",
    "\n",
    "However we could state that the \"worst-case\" round for collecting a piece of food is one in which:\n",
    "\n",
    "* only one piece of food spawns at any given time\n",
    "* snake just ate, next piece of food spawns just behind snake's head\n",
    "* snake currently occupies the entire grid without touching itself\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to reach the next piece of food the snake will need to travel the entire distance of the grid, `-1`. This is because if the snake literally traveled the entire distance it would end up in the starting position, we need to go just 1 short of this. In fact, this generalizes to `- |F|` where `|F|` is the number of food that can spawn at any given time because for each piece of food that is spawned, we know 2 food cannot occupy the same location, so each subsequent food is in the next-worst location that maximizes the snake's distance traveled (and thus must be 1 step closer on the snake's optimal path.) However, in such a case, we know the snake eats `F` food if it simply travels the distance of the `grid area -1`, as it will have reached every position that a food occupied when it first set out on its journey and food do not move until eaten. Therefore, the amortized upper-bound time cost per food eaten when there are `|F|` food is `(grid_area - 1)/|F|` ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an initial estimate on upper-bound of time cost to reach \"end game snake length\" is `(grid_area + 1) * ((grid_area -1)/|F|)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjecture 1**: A snake whose body length is at least `game.grid_width * game.grid_height` can *always* reach the next piece of food within `2*len(snake) + 2` ticks. Thus we would have a worst case time to maximum snake-length:\n",
    "\n",

    "        (game.grid_width * game.grid_height - 1) / len(food) #3\n",
    "    )\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note \\#1: The minimum of case \\#2 and case \\#3 could be less than the corner-to-corner manhattan distance of the game grid. Thus, \\#1 accounts for the case where snake length is still small and a piece of food spawns on the opposite side of the game map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note \\#2: Trivially, we know from above that a snake that is already head-to-tail can reach the next piece of food when that piece of food. However, in that proof, the snake was OK with dying for the last piece. In this case, we may need to create a 'kink' as space permits.\n",
